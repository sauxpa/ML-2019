# ML_101

101 machine learning scripts:

## RL 

Elementary gridworld environments and standard, exact RL algo to solve the underlying MDP (SARSA, Q-Learning, with or without experience replay).

## circle_classificaiton

Showcase of scikit-learn classifier on the circle dataset.

## lasso 

Tensorflow implementation of Lasso regression, with plots to track the sparsity of regularized predictors.

## Misc

* Discrete Random Number Generator: comparison of numpy.rd.choice vs manually implemented generators (using only numpy.rd.uniform).

* Ensemble learning 101: again, showcase of scikit-learn classifiers and a few aggregation methods (voting, boosting, bagging).

* Labeled Faces In The Wild : again. showcase of scikit-learn classifiers on face recognition (no deep learning involved).

* Temporal regularization in MDP : study of an article (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00429.pdf) about solving MDP by optimizing simultaneously the orignal and time-reversed chains. This leads to a biased yet typically lower variance solution.

* reservoir_sampling : toy example of a sampling technique from an array of unknown size.
